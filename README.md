# Dispatch

A guide to the perfect day out — save places, tag them by when they fit into
a day, and generate a plan that keeps things close together, inside budget,
and ahead of anything closing soon.

Built with React + Vite, deployed on Vercel. Places are saved to
**browser local storage** — this app is single-device by design (see
*Upgrading persistence* below if you want it to sync across devices later).

## Features

- **Save places** to a personal collection, each tagged as breakfast,
  daytime activity, evening activity, dinner, or drinks, with a city,
  approximate cost, and notes.
- **Google Places search** when adding a place, so you get a real address and
  coordinates without typing them by hand (optional — you can also add a
  place manually).
- **Plan generator** — pick a city and day or evening, and it suggests a set
  of stops (day = breakfast + activity + optional drink after; evening =
  drinks + dinner + activity), favoring combinations that sit close together.
- **Budget bracket** — cap the plan's total estimated spend.
- **Closing soon** — give an exhibition an end date and it's flagged and
  prioritized in plans as the date approaches (within 3 weeks).
- **Favorites & "try new"** — mark places you loved, then generate a plan
  biased toward favorites, or toward things you haven't been to yet.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
```

You have two options for running it locally:

**Without a Google API key** — place search will silently skip results and
you can still add places manually (name, city, address typed by hand; no
coordinates, so proximity scoring is neutral instead of distance-based):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**With place search working** — you need the Vercel CLI, since `/api/places`
is a serverless function:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY
vercel dev
```

## Setting up Google Places API

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Enable **Places API (New)**.
3. Create an API key (Credentials → Create Credentials → API key).
4. Since the key is only ever called from the serverless function
   (`api/places.js`), never from the browser, you can restrict it to your
   server's IPs or leave it unrestricted for a personal project — just don't
   put it in any client-side code or `VITE_`-prefixed env var.
5. Enable billing on the project. As of 2026 Google gives each Places API SKU
   its own free monthly allowance (10,000 calls/month on the Essentials-tier
   search this app uses), so a personal project will very likely stay free —
   but Google still requires billing to be enabled to unlock the free tier.

## The header

The masthead is a 4×2 grid of your own photos (`public/photos/header-1.jpg`
through `header-8.jpg`), with a "Dispatch" title card overlaid on top of the
two middle columns. To swap in different photos, just replace those 8 files
with the same names (square-ish crops work best, 500×500px is plenty) — no
code changes needed.

## Opening hours, editing, and photos

- **Opening hours** — when you add a place via the Google Places search, its
  hours come along automatically and the plan generator uses them: a place
  is excluded from a suggested plan only when its hours clearly show it's
  closed at that slot's typical time (breakfast ~9am, day activity ~2pm,
  drinks ~6pm, dinner ~8pm, night activity ~10pm), based on today's day of
  week. Places without hours data (added manually) are never penalized —
  missing data is treated as "unknown," not "closed." Cards also show a
  quick "open now / closed now" hint when hours are available.
- **Editing** — every card has an "edit" button that reopens the same form
  pre-filled, so you can retag a place, fix a typo, or add photos without
  starting over.
- **Photos** — each place can have its own small gallery, added from the
  form. Photos are stored in the browser's IndexedDB (not localStorage,
  which is too small for real images) and resized/compressed client-side
  before saving. Click a thumbnail on a card to view it full-size.

## Notes on place search accuracy

Google's Text Search API infers location from the requesting server's IP
address when no explicit bias is given — since `api/places.js` runs on
Vercel's US infrastructure, searches would otherwise skew American
regardless of what city you type. The function now includes a small
city → coordinates lookup and passes an explicit `locationBias` circle
(40km radius) around the typed city to Google, so results stay local.

This lookup covers common cities but isn't exhaustive — if you search in a
city that isn't in `CITY_COORDS` (in `api/places.js`), it'll fall back to
the old text-based "in {city}" phrasing only, which can occasionally drift.
Add more cities to that list as you need them; each entry is just
`cityname: [latitude, longitude]`.

## Deploying

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new). It auto-detects Vite and
   the `api/` folder as serverless functions — no config needed.
3. In the Vercel project settings, add an environment variable:
   `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` = your key.
4. Deploy. Place search will work in production once the key is set; the
   app itself works with or without it.

## Upgrading persistence (optional, later)

Right now everything lives in `src/lib/storage.js`, which reads/writes a
single `localStorage` key. If you later want plans and places to sync across
devices, swap that file for calls to a hosted database (Supabase's free tier
is a natural fit for a project this size) — nothing else in the app needs to
change, since every component only talks to `getPlaces` / `addPlace` /
`updatePlace` / `deletePlace`.
